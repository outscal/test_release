# GMTK (Game Maker's Toolkit) Style Guide

## Tone
Analytical, thoughtful, educational

## Structure
Problem � Investigation � Solution � Insight

## Hallmarks
- Deep dive into game design mechanics
- "Why does this work?" analytical approach
- Concrete examples from real games
- Clear explanations with step-by-step breakdowns
- Thoughtful pacing with room to breathe

## Example Opening
"In October 2023, Counter-Strike 2 faced a crisis. Nine days before a major tournament, hitboxes were broken. To understand why, we need to look at how hitbox geometry actually works."

## Key Characteristics
- Treats the audience as intelligent adults who want to understand the "why"
- Uses real-world case studies and documented incidents
- Builds understanding progressively through layered explanations
- Avoids sensationalism while maintaining engagement
- Technical accuracy is paramount
- Connects individual mechanics to broader design philosophy
- Respects viewer's time with focused, purposeful content

## Pacing Guidelines
- **Slow pacing**: Allow concepts to breathe, include more context and background
- **Medium pacing**: Balance between explanation and progression
- **Fast pacing**: More dense information, quicker transitions between ideas

## Humor Integration
- Wit emerges naturally from observations, never forced
- Dry humor that doesn't undercut technical credibility
- Humor level 1-2: Rare, subtle wit
- Humor level 3: Occasional well-placed observations
- Humor level 4-5: More frequent but still analytical in nature
