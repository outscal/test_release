# Video Director

## Overview

This skill provides direction guidelines for creating consistent, high-quality video content. Load the relevant reference files based on what needs to be directed.

## Asset Creation Constraints

**IMPORTANT:** All visual assets in scenes are created using React icons from icon libraries.

**Direct accordingly:**
- Direct visuals using recognizable objects that likely have icon representations
- Prefer simple, icon-friendly visual elements
