# PUNCHY - Shorts Style Guide

## Core Identity

**One-line description:** High-energy, pattern-interrupt explainer that hooks in 2 seconds and delivers one powerful insight.

**Target audience:** Tech-curious viewers scrolling TikTok, YouTube Shorts, or Instagram Reels who want to feel smarter in under a minute.

**Platform optimization:** TikTok-first (algorithm rewards immediate hooks and high retention), translates well to Shorts and Reels.

## Tone & Energy

### Pacing
- **FAST** - No wasted words, no filler
- Sentences are punchy and direct
- Information density is high
- Cuts would happen every 2-4 seconds if this were edited video

### Energy Level
- Opens at 8/10 energy (hook demands attention)
- Body maintains 6-7/10 (informative but not exhausting)
- Callback spikes to 8/10 (satisfying punchline)

### Humor Style
- Dry wit over loud comedy
- Irony and understatement
- Absurdist observations about technical things
- Memes referenced subtly, not explicitly
- Self-aware about the format

## Structure Template

### Hook (First 3-5 seconds)
**Pattern interrupt.** Do NOT ease into it. Start mid-action.

Techniques:
- **Statistic slam:** "Thirty bullets. Zero damage."
- **Counterintuitive statement:** "The fix made it worse."
- **Specific absurdity:** "Nine days before the tournament, the game broke."
- **Bold claim:** "This ten-line function runs in every game you've ever played."

What to AVOID:
- "Hey guys" / "What's up"
- "Did you know..." (too soft)
- "Today I'm going to explain..." (death sentence)
- Any question that doesn't demand an answer

### Context (Next 5-10 seconds)
**Quick setup.** Establish what we're talking about and why it matters.

- One or two sentences max
- Name the game/topic specifically
- Hint at the stakes or the "why should I care"
- Bridge from hook to insight

### Core Insight (Main 15-35 seconds) - THE MEAT
**The ONE thing.** Not two things. Not three. ONE.

**🚨 THIS IS WHERE THE "WOW FACTOR" LIVES. Don't waste it on surface-level facts.**

Structure options:
- **Cause → Effect:** "They changed X. This caused Y."
- **Problem → Solution → But:** "The problem was X. They fixed it with Y. But Y created Z."
- **Timeline:** "First X happened. Then Y. Then everything broke."

Requirements:
- Use specific numbers when available
- One concrete example or proof point
- **Explain the MECHANISM, not just the outcome**
- Keep it visual (describe things that could be shown)

**🚨 THE MECHANISM RULE:**

Every technical insight MUST explain HOW it works, not just WHAT happened.

**❌ BAD (Surface-level):**
> "Capsules are smaller than boxes. Your bullets miss."

**✅ GOOD (Explains the mechanism):**
> "Capsules are mathematically smaller than boxes. And during animations, when your character leans or crouches, the capsule stays in place while your model moves. Twenty centimeter gap. Your bullets hit the model but miss the hitbox."

**❌ BAD (Just the fact):**
> "The game calculates physics 2000 times per second."

**✅ GOOD (Fact + mechanism + consequence):**
> "Each beam has four properties: stiffness, damping, deform threshold, snap point. The engine recalculates all of them 2000 times per second. That's why the same crash never looks the same twice."

**The Mechanism Formula:**
```
[What happened] + [How it actually works] + [Why that matters to the viewer]
```

### Callback (Final 5-10 seconds)
**Tie back to hook.** This is what makes it memorable.

Techniques:
- Echo the hook's language with new meaning
- Reveal what the hook was really about
- Punchline that reframes everything
- "So next time..." that connects to viewer's life

What to AVOID:
- "Like and subscribe"
- "Follow for more"
- "Let me know in the comments"
- Generic summary of what you just said

## Hallmarks of Punchy Style

### Signature Techniques

1. **Mid-action opens:** Start in the middle of the most interesting moment
   - ✅ "Zero damage. Thirty bullets, point blank."
   - ❌ "So there's this game called Counter-Strike..."

2. **Specificity over generality:** Numbers, names, dates
   - ✅ "Nine days before IEM Sydney"
   - ❌ "Right before a big tournament"

3. **Dry callbacks:** Understate the punchline for impact
   - ✅ "It's not your aim. It's geometry."
   - ❌ "So that's why hitboxes are SO important and you should care about them!"

4. **One-word transitions:** "But." / "Why?" / "Because."
   - ✅ "But capsules are smaller."
   - ❌ "However, there's an important caveat to consider here."

5. **Technical made relatable:** Explain complex things simply without dumbing down
   - ✅ "The hitbox stays still while your character model moves. Twenty centimeter gap."
   - ❌ "The hitbox desynchronization occurs due to animation interpolation discrepancies."

### What Punchy Scripts Sound Like

- Confident but not arrogant
- Smart but not condescending
- Fast but not rushed
- Funny but not trying too hard
- Informative but not lecture-y

### Rhythm Pattern

Short. Short. Medium length sentence that explains the thing. Short punch.

Example:
"Zero damage. Thirty bullets. Valve had just upgraded hitboxes from boxes to capsules, which sounds better until you realize capsules are smaller. The model moved. The hitbox didn't."

## Example Openings

### Gaming/Technical:
"Zero damage. Thirty bullets, point blank, zero damage. This happened nine days before the biggest CS2 tournament."

"Every game you've ever played uses the same collision detection algorithm. It was written in nineteen eighty-eight."

"Minecraft runs at twenty ticks per second. Redstone engineers have built CPUs inside this limitation."

### Tech/Software:
"This function has sixteen million downloads per week. It's four lines of code. Two of them are wrong."

"Google's code review process rejected the code that became Gmail. Twice."

"The most downloaded NPM package does literally nothing. On purpose."

### Language/Culture:
"Demure. August fifth to August seventeenth. Twelve days from viral to vintage."

"Gen Z invented a word specifically to mock millennials trying to be cool. It worked."

## 🚨 What Punchy NEVER Does (Anti-AI-Slop Rules)

**These rules are MANDATORY. Violating them makes the script UNUSABLE.**

### Forbidden Patterns (INSTANT REJECTION):

#### 1. Three-Word Repetitive Patterns
- ❌ "It's fast. It's powerful. It's amazing."
- ❌ "Simple. Clean. Effective."
- ❌ "Precise. Accurate. Deadly."

#### 2. Question-Answer Listing ("X? Y.")
- ❌ "Hitboxes? Broken. Shots? Broken. Damage? Zero."
- ❌ "The solution? Simple. The problem? Not so much."

#### 3. Hypothetical Game Scenarios
- ❌ "Imagine you're holding a gun and you look at the door"
- ❌ "Picture this: You're in a match and suddenly..."
- ❌ "Picture yourself peeking mid..."

#### 4. Imaginary Player Perspectives
- ❌ "You're in a 1v1 clutch..."
- ❌ "You're holding an AWP, waiting for that perfect shot..."
- ❌ "You feel the frustration as your bullets phase through..."

#### 5. Mechanical Listing Transitions
- ❌ "First... Second... Third..."
- ❌ "Now let's talk about..."
- ❌ "Moving on to..."

#### 6. Hype Phrases
- ❌ "game-changer"
- ❌ "revolutionary"
- ❌ "mind-blowing"
- ❌ "insane" / "absolutely insane"
- ❌ "incredible" / "amazing" / "unbelievable"

### Forbidden Openings:
- "Hey everyone" / "What's up guys"
- "So today we're going to..."
- "Have you ever wondered..."
- "In this video..."
- "Before we start..."
- "Let's dive in"

### Forbidden Transitions:
- "Here's the thing"
- "Here's the kicker"
- "Here's where it gets interesting"
- "Now, you might be thinking"
- "Let me explain"
- "So basically"
- "The interesting part is"
- "But there's a twist"
- "At the end of the day"
- "The bottom line is"

### Forbidden Closings:
- "So that's why X is important"
- "And that's the story of..."
- "Hope you learned something"
- "Like and subscribe for more"
- Summarizing what you just said

### Forbidden Behaviors:
- Starting slow and building up (shorts don't have time)
- Multiple points or tangents (one insight only)
- Asking viewers what they think mid-video
- Breaking the fourth wall unnecessarily
- Explaining that you're explaining ("Let me break this down")

## Adapting to Humor Levels

### Humor Level 1-2 (Minimal):
- Dry, almost documentary tone
- Wit comes from specificity, not jokes
- Let the absurdity of the facts speak for itself
- Example: "The hitbox stayed in place. The model didn't. Professional players noticed."

### Humor Level 3 (Balanced):
- Occasional wry observation
- Understatement for comedic effect
- One good line per script
- Example: "The fix that was supposed to make hitboxes better made them worse. Classic."

### Humor Level 4-5 (Maximum):
- More personality in delivery
- Absurdist comparisons allowed
- Self-aware about the format
- Example: "Thirty bullets. Zero damage. At this point the hitbox was basically in another timezone."

## Technical Depth Guidelines

### For Technical Topics:
- Assume viewer knows nothing but isn't stupid
- One technical term max, immediately explained
- Focus on the "why" and "so what"
- Visual descriptions (what would you show?)

### For Cultural/Trend Topics:
- Specific examples over general statements
- Dates and timelines create credibility
- Quote real sources when possible
- Connect to viewer's potential experience

## Final Checklist for Punchy Scripts

Before considering a script complete:

**🚨 TECHNICAL DEPTH CHECKS (MOST IMPORTANT - INSTANT REJECTION IF FAILED):**
- [ ] **MECHANISM EXPLAINED:** Script explains HOW the tech works, not just WHAT it does
- [ ] **CONTRAST PRESENT:** Shows what's different about this vs. the norm
- [ ] **NUMBERS HAVE CONTEXT:** Every number explains what it means in practice
- [ ] **COUNTERINTUITIVE FACT:** Contains at least one "wait, really?" moment
- [ ] **REPEATABLE INSIGHT:** Viewer learns something they could explain to a friend

**Technical Depth Examples:**

❌ **FAILS depth check:**
> "Capsules are smaller than boxes. Your bullets miss."

✅ **PASSES depth check:**
> "Capsules are mathematically smaller than boxes. And during animations, when your character leans, the capsule stays put while the model moves. Twenty centimeter gap. Your bullets hit the model but phase through the hitbox."

**🚨 Anti-AI-Slop Checks (INSTANT REJECTION):**
- [ ] No three-word repetitive patterns ("It's X. It's Y. It's Z.")
- [ ] No "X? Y." question-answer listing
- [ ] No hypothetical scenarios ("Imagine you're...", "Picture this...")
- [ ] No imaginary player perspectives ("You're in a 1v1 clutch...")
- [ ] No mechanical listing ("First... Second... Third...")
- [ ] No hype phrases ("game-changer", "mind-blowing", "insane", "amazing")
- [ ] No formulaic openings/closings ("Let's dive in", "At the end of the day", "Here's the thing")

**Structure Checks:**
- [ ] First sentence is a hook (no preamble)
- [ ] Hook would make someone stop scrolling
- [ ] Only ONE core insight in the entire script
- [ ] Every sentence adds new information
- [ ] Callback references or echoes the hook
- [ ] Could be cut into 2-4 second visual segments

**Quality Check:**
- [ ] Sounds like a confident person explaining something cool, not reading a script
- [ ] Facts speak for themselves (no hype needed)
