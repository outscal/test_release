# OUTSCAL - Shorts Style Guide

## 🚨 CRITICAL: SENTENCE FLOW RULES

**Every sentence must CONNECT to the next. No disconnected fragments.**

✅ **CORRECT FLOW:**
> "This game literally scars you for every mistake you make. **See,** Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater just dropped the most brutal feedback system in gaming. Every time you get hurt, it leaves something behind."

❌ **WRONG (Disconnected):**
> "Scars. Permanent. Brutal. The feedback system tracks everything."

**The secret to Outscal scripts:**
1. Hook → "See," → Context → "But" → Technical → "Meaning," → Escalation → Payoff
2. Every sentence flows INTO the next
3. Use the exact transitional phrases (See, Meaning, Therefore, But here's where it gets...)

## Narrative Structure: 5-Beat Arc (~200 Words)

### Beat 1: HOOK (1 line, 15 words max)
Bold technical claim, comparison, or "secret" mechanism reveal.

**Hook Patterns (replace [Subject] with your actual topic from research):**
- "This is how [Subject] secretly [mechanism]"
- "Why does [Subject A]'s [approach] make [Subject B] look broken?"
- "[Subject] literally [extreme technical claim]"
- "You won't believe how [Subject] [technical detail]"
- "This is the [superlative] way [Subject] has ever [achievement]"
- "[Subject] was so [adjective] that it nearly [extreme consequence]"
- "[Subject] has been lying about being [perceived quality]"
- "Did you know [Subject] is [designed/built] to [counterintuitive action]?"

**Examples from dataset (gaming - shows STYLE, not required topic):**
- "This game literally scars you for every mistake you make."
- "Why does Ghost of Tsushima's fake cloth physics make Batman's cape look broken?"
- "Batman's cape was so complex that it nearly burned down the PlayStation 3."

**How these patterns work for OTHER topics:**
- AI: "This is how ChatGPT secretly forgets everything you tell it."
- Finance: "Why does index investing make hedge funds look broken?"
- Science: "CRISPR was so powerful that it nearly got banned worldwide."
- Culture: "TikTok's algorithm literally rewires how Gen Z learns language."

### Beat 2: CONTEXT / PROBLEM (1-2 lines)
Explain what "most [things in this category]" do (the lazy/broken way).

**Pattern:** "See, most [category] [lazy solution]. But [Smart Subject]..."

**Examples from dataset (gaming):**
- "See, most AAA games brute force cloth simulation with expensive real-time physics, but still end up with capes that spaz out and destroy your CPU."
- "You see, most racing games just make the track wet and call it realistic weather."

**How this pattern works for OTHER topics:**
- Tech: "See, most APIs just return error codes and call it error handling. But this system..."
- Finance: "You see, most investors just buy the dip and hope. But this strategy..."
- Science: "See, most studies just measure correlation. But this research..."
- Culture: "See, most slang takes decades to spread. But TikTok's algorithm..."

### Beat 3: TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE (Main section) - THE MEAT
Explain the clever solution with specific terminology - this is where the "wow factor" lives.

**🚨 THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION. This is what separates good shorts from forgettable ones.**

**Requirements:**
- Use real technical terms from YOUR topic (not gaming terms for non-gaming topics)
- **Explain the MECHANISM, not just the outcome** (HOW it works, not just WHAT it does)
- Keep it visual (describe things that could be shown)
- One concrete example or proof point

**Technical terms vary by topic - use terms from YOUR research:**
- Gaming: voxels, vertices, GPU instancing, shaders
- AI: transformers, attention mechanisms, token limits, fine-tuning
- Finance: yield curves, liquidity pools, arbitrage, derivatives
- Biology: CRISPR, gene expression, protein folding
- Culture: algorithm, engagement metrics, virality coefficient

**🚨 THE MECHANISM RULE:**

Every technical claim MUST explain the underlying mechanism. Don't just state facts - explain WHY.

**❌ BAD (Surface-level):**
> "BeamNG calculates 2000 times per second."

**✅ GOOD (Explains the mechanism):**
> "Each of BeamNG's four thousand beams has four properties: stiffness, damping, deform threshold, and snap point. The engine recalculates all of them two thousand times per second. That's why the same crash never looks the same twice."

**❌ BAD (Just numbers):**
> "The game uses 400 nodes and 4000 beams."

**✅ GOOD (Numbers with meaning):**
> "Four hundred nodes connected by four thousand beams. Each beam can stretch, compress, permanently deform, or snap. Most games swap pre-made damage meshes. BeamNG simulates actual metal physics."

**The Mechanism Formula:**
```
[Technical fact] + [How it actually works] + [Why that matters]
```

**Examples:**
- "Temporal rewind. When you shoot, the server rewinds to what was on YOUR screen, not where enemies are NOW. That's why blood appears behind enemies you just killed."
- "Each beam has a deform threshold. Hit it hard enough and the beam permanently bends. Hit it harder and it snaps. That's real metal physics, not pre-baked animations."
- "The game tracks elevation, humidity, and surface temperature. When you spin out in rain, it's because the physics engine calculated the exact grip loss for those conditions."

### Beat 4: ESCALATION
Add another layer of complexity or absurdity.

**Escalation Phrases:**
- "But here's where it gets [insane/crazy/wild]"
- "But here's the thing/problem"
- "And the [craziest/funniest/worst] part?"
- "But it gets [better/worse]"
- "But that's not even the [worst/best/craziest] part"

**Examples:**
- "But here's where it gets insane. The game is secretly tracking elevation pressure, humidity, and surface temperature in real time."
- "But all that tech created an unexpected exploit. Speedrunners figured out how to use the cape to clip through walls."
- "And the funniest part, racing sim nerds are still gatekeeping Gran Turismo while this arcade game is running climate simulations."

### Beat 5: INSIGHT / PAYOFF
Ironic observation, unexpected consequence, or meaningful insight. End with a satisfying payoff that ties back to the hook.

---

## Rhythm & Line Structure

### Sentence Rhythm
Alternates between:
- **Short technical stabs:** 3-6 words
- **Medium explainers:** 12-18 words
- **NO run-ons or paragraphs**

### One Thought Per Line
Designed for vertical fast scroll. Each line = one idea.

### Sentence Openers (Transitional Tics) - USE THESE EXACTLY
- **"See,"** (most common opener - USE THIS after every hook)
- **"You see,"** (variant)
- **"Meaning,"** (consequence connector)
- **"Therefore,"** (logical conclusion)
- **"So,"** (casual consequence)
- **"And it works."** (validation)
- **"And the funniest part"** (ironic addition)
- **"And the craziest part"** (escalation addition)

### Escalation Phrases - USE THESE EXACTLY
- **"But here's where it gets insane."**
- **"But here's the crazy part."**
- **"But here's where it gets wild."**
- **"But it gets better."**
- **"But it gets worse."**
- **"But it gets even better."**
- **"But here's the problem."**
- **"But here's the thing."**

## Example Scripts (From Dataset)

**🚨 IMPORTANT: These examples are gaming-focused because that's the original dataset. They demonstrate the STYLE and FLOW, not the required TOPIC. Apply this same style to whatever topic your research covers.**

**What to learn from these examples:**
- The "See," opener after every hook
- The "Most [X] do Y. But [subject]..." contrast pattern
- The "But here's where it gets insane" escalation
- The connected sentence flow (no fragments)
- The technical depth with mechanism explanations

### Example 1: Metal Gear Solid Scar System
```
This game literally scars you for every mistake you make. See, Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater just dropped the most brutal feedback system in gaming. Every time you get hurt, it leaves something behind. A bruise, a cut, a blood stain, or some form of injury. The game engine logs the hit location in injury type, then layers a texture, like a bruise or blood splatter directly onto Snake's character model. But this is where it gets f*cked up. Instead of removing these textures when you heal, the game stores them in what's basically a scar memory bank. And these scars never disappear. Your character becomes a walking highlight reel of every time you screwed up. And it works. You start playing way more carefully, not for health bars, but because you don't want to mess him up even more. And by the time game's over, no two snakes ever look the same. We break down the full stealth AI system right here.
```

### Example 2: Sea of Thieves Weather
```
This is the smartest way a game has ever faked realistic weather. See, most developers are lazy as hell when it comes to weather. They'll throw some raindrops, add a lightning flash, and call it a day. But Sea of Thieves said, "F*ck that." and built a full physics simulation synchronized across every player in the session. So when a massive wave slams your ship and sends you flying, your buddy on the other side of the map will also get hit by that exact same wave at that exact moment. Lightning bolts aren't just random pretty effects. They strike at the same coordinates for everyone. And that wind screwing with your sails. It's actually a wind vector field. Basically a 3D map of wind direction with storm intensity multipliers that crank up the chaos in real time. But here's where it gets insane. Instead of weather just teleporting in like some broken mod, storms roll in gradually with smooth transitions. You're not just surviving a storm. You're surviving a shared storm that's messing with everyone equally. Full breakdown of the wave physics engine right here.
```

### Example 3: Valorant Temporal Rewind
```
You won't believe how Valorant uses time travel to fix your trashy aim. That perfect headshot in Valorant feels so satisfying because the game is doing something almost magical behind the scenes. Most shooters have a brutal reality. Your perfect headshot might miss because while your bullet travels through the internet, the enemy has already moonwalked to safety. And if your connection is slower than your reaction time, good luck landing anything. Valorant fixed this with a mindblowing solution. Temporal rewind. When you shoot, your game tells the server exactly when you fired. The problem with most shooters, they check hits based on where enemies are now, not where they were when you saw them. Valorant server rewinds the match to what was on your screen when you fired. Judging your shot based on what you saw, not where enemies ran while your bullet was in digital traffic. That's why blood appears behind an enemy you just shot. Whether your ping is 20 or 200, if your aim was true, you get the kill. The complete netcode breakdown is right here.
```

### Example 4: Forza Horizon 5 Physics
```
Forza Horizon 5 has been lying about being casual. You see, while everyone's complaining that this isn't a real racing sim, Playground Games went ahead and built the most advanced physics engine in racing. They literally used volumetric terrain scanning to map every single surface. Meaning, when you hit that dirt road, it's not some generic dirt texture. It responds exactly like that specific patch of soil would. But here's where it gets insane. The game is secretly tracking elevation pressure, humidity, and surface temperature in real time. So, when you spin out during a thunderstorm, it's because the game calculated the exact atmospheric conditions affecting your tire grip. And the funniest part is that racing sim nerds are still gatekeeping Gran Turismo while this arcade game is running climate simulations behind Rainbow Roads. Horizon 5 players are literally experiencing simulation level realism while jamming the EDM beats.
```

### Example 5: Batman's Cape
```
Batman's cape was so complex that it nearly burned down the PlayStation 3. Arkham devs built the whole combat system in just four months. But Batman's cape wasn't that easy. A team of six engineers spent two full years building it. They had to craft an entirely separate physics engine with a 20 bone skeleton just for the cloth to behave realistically. Therefore, every glide and cape swirl had to feel cinematic no matter the angle or speed. But the realism almost broke the game. Early PS3 dev kits would get smoked and catch fire when Batman glided too fast. Therefore, they ended up cutting three boss fights just to free up processing power for the cape to work without crashing the system. But all that tech created an unexpected exploit. Speedrunners figured out how to use the cape to clip through walls and set world records. Therefore, when devs tried to patch it, they accidentally broke the combat system even more, triggering the now infamous T Pose Batman glitch.
```

### Example 6: Ghost of Tsushima Honor System
```
This is how Ghost of Tsushima secretly tracks your honor. See, every time you backstab some poor guard instead of dueling him like a real samurai, the game judges you. It's literally running a hidden morality calculator in the background. And when you rack up enough sneaky kills, the storm clouds roll in. But if you're out doing honorable standoffs and facing enemies head on, you get sunshine and cherry blossoms. The craziest part is that the game never tells you this is happening, but the engine is constantly tracking every action you make. Each backstab updates this hidden honor variable. Then the weather system checks that variable and cranks up the storm probability. It's literally coding guilt trip into the sky. The developers confirm that your morality controls the weather.
```

### Example 7: Death Stranding Multiplayer
```
You might have never seen multiplayer like this before. See, Death Stranding's multiplayer doesn't work like any other game. You never actually see another player in your world. Instead, the game uses something called the Social Strand System, an asynchronous multiplayer network where structures you build appear in other players games. But here's the smart part. The server doesn't just dump every structure from every player into your world. It runs a curation algorithm that selects which structures appear based on multiple factors. Your friends list, like counts, durability levels, and spatial density caps. But these structures also decay over time, and Timefall Rain accelerates decay by two to three times. But here's where the cooperation kicks in. Any player can repair any structure by donating materials. It's basically like the Dark Souls player messages system, but more complex.
```

## 🚨 What Outscal NEVER Does (Anti-AI-Slop Rules)

**These rules are MANDATORY. Violating them makes the script UNUSABLE.**

### Forbidden Patterns (INSTANT REJECTION):

#### 1. Three-Word Repetitive Patterns
- ❌ "It's fast. It's powerful. It's amazing."
- ❌ "Simple. Clean. Effective."

#### 2. Question-Answer Listing ("X? Y.")
- ❌ "Hitboxes? Broken. Shots? Broken. Damage? Zero."
- ❌ "The solution? Simple. The problem? Not so much."

#### 3. Generic Hypothetical Scenarios (NOT from research)
- ❌ "Imagine you're holding a gun and you look at the door" (if not from actual game mechanic)
- ❌ "Picture yourself in a 1v1 clutch..."
- ✅ OK if describing actual game mechanic: "So when you spin out during a thunderstorm, it's because the game calculated the exact atmospheric conditions"

#### 4. Hype Phrases Without Technical Backing
- ❌ "game-changer" (without explaining WHY)
- ❌ "revolutionary" (without technical proof)
- ❌ "mind-blowing" (as standalone hype)
- ✅ OK: "mindblowing solution. Temporal rewind." (followed by explanation)

#### 5. Generic Transitions
- ❌ "First... Second... Third..."
- ❌ "Moving on to..."
- ❌ "Next up..."
- ✅ USE: "See," / "Meaning," / "Therefore," / "But here's where it gets [crazy]"

### Content Rules:

## Adapting to Humor Levels

### Humor Level 1-2 (Minimal):
- Technical explanations with dry observations
- Let the absurdity of engineering speak for itself
- Example: "The game stores them in what's basically a scar memory bank. And these scars never disappear."

### Humor Level 3 (Balanced):
- Technical irony present
- One good roast per script
- Example: "Most developers are lazy as hell when it comes to weather. They'll throw some raindrops, add a lightning flash, and call it a day."

### Humor Level 4-5 (Maximum):
- Full lazy dev roasts
- Absurdist consequences highlighted
- Community roasts included
- Example: "And the funniest part, racing sim nerds are still gatekeeping Gran Turismo while this arcade game is running climate simulations behind Rainbow Roads."

## The Magic Formula

```
"See, most [topic] [lazy/common approach]. But [Smart Example] [clever approach].
Meaning [technical explanation]. But here's where it gets crazy. [Extra layer].
Therefore [ironic observation that ties back to the hook]."
```

**Example Flow:**
```
"See, most slang took decades to spread. But TikTok built an algorithm that does it in hours.
Meaning demure hit millions before the weekend. But here's where it gets insane. By the time you Googled it, Gen Z already moved on.
Therefore you're not slow. The algorithm is just faster than human learning."
```

## Final Checklist for Outscal Scripts

**🚨 TECHNICAL DEPTH CHECKS (MOST IMPORTANT - INSTANT REJECTION IF FAILED):**
- [ ] **MINIMUM 2 MECHANISM EXPLANATIONS:** Script has at least TWO "wow factor" technical insights that explain HOW something works
- [ ] **CONTRAST PRESENT:** "Most [category] do X. But [subject] does Y." pattern used with mechanism explanation
- [ ] **NUMBERS HAVE CONTEXT:** Every number explains what it means in practice
- [ ] **COUNTERINTUITIVE FACT:** Contains at least one "wait, really?" moment
- [ ] **REPEATABLE INSIGHT:** Viewer learns something they could explain to a friend
- [ ] **TECHNICAL TERMS EXPLAINED:** Jargon is used BUT made accessible

**🚨 THE "2 WOW MOMENTS" RULE:**

Every shorts script MUST contain at least TWO distinct mechanism explanations ("wow factor" lines). One is not enough.

**Example - A script with only 1 wow moment (FAILS):**
> "Each beam has four properties: stiffness, damping, deform threshold, snap point."

That's ONE mechanism. Where's the second?

**Example - A script with 2 wow moments (PASSES):**
> **Wow #1:** "Each beam has four properties: stiffness, damping, deform threshold, snap point. Hit it hard enough and the beam permanently bends. Hit it harder and it snaps."
>
> **Wow #2:** "Most games pre-bake three damage states - pristine, dented, destroyed - and swap between them. BeamNG calculates real deformation. That's why you can T-bone a car and watch the door fold inward exactly where you hit it."

Both explain HOW something works, not just WHAT happens.

**Technical Depth Examples:**

❌ **FAILS depth check:**
> "They built 400 nodes and 4000 beams calculating 2000 times per second."

✅ **PASSES depth check:**
> "Four hundred nodes connected by four thousand beams. Each beam has stiffness, damping, a deform threshold, and a snap point. The engine recalculates all of them two thousand times per second. Most games swap pre-made dent meshes. BeamNG simulates how actual metal bends."

**🚨 Anti-AI-Slop Checks:**
- [ ] No three-word repetitive patterns
- [ ] No generic "X? Y." listing
- [ ] No hype words without technical backing
- [ ] Uses Outscal transitional tics ("See," / "Meaning," / "Therefore,")
- [ ] Technical terms included naturally (minimum 3)

**Structure Checks:**
- [ ] Full 5-beat narrative spine achieved (Hook → Context → Deep Dive → Escalation → Payoff)
- [ ] Hook is bold technical claim (15 words max)
- [ ] Contrast setup present ("Most [topic] do X. But [Example]...")
- [ ] Escalation phrase used ("But here's where it gets [insane]")
- [ ] Payoff ties back to the hook

**Content Checks:**
- [ ] Explains HOW the subject works technically, not surface-level stories
- [ ] Humor beats present (minimum 2: roast, irony, or absurdity)
- [ ] Factual accuracy from R&D Notes only
- [ ] Word count ~200 words (for 60-sec) or scaled appropriately

**Alignment Check:**
- [ ] Does this sound like an expert educator explaining HOW things work, not someone telling surface-level stories?
- [ ] Does the topic match the research (NOT defaulting to gaming)?
