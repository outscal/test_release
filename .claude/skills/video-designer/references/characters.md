# Character Design

## System Constraints

> **IMPORTANT - Design Philosophy:**
> These primitive shape characters (think Hey Duggee, Dumb Ways to Die) are the **ONLY** character style allowed.
> Do NOT design complex multi-part characters, realistic characters, or detailed illustrations.
> Keep it simple: single geometric body shape with an expressive face.

**Colors:** Character body colors are based on the video's art_style specifications.

**Structure:**
- Body = ONE geometric shape (this IS the head+torso, no separate head)
- Body should be a single vibrant color

**Face:**
- White circular eyes with black pupils
- Colored circular cheeks
- Simple curved mouth
- All facial features stay inside the body shape

## Constraints

| ✅ ALLOWED | ❌ NOT ALLOWED |
|-----------|----------------|
| Any geometric body shape | New body parts (tails, wings, arms, legs) |
| Any color combination | Breaking/detaching body parts |
| Facial expressions with animations | - |

## Objects & Props

When a character needs to interact with or "hold" an object:
- Place the object on the **right side** of the character
- The object does NOT need to touch the character's body
- Characters do not literally hold objects (no arms/legs to hold with)
- Simply position the object near the character to show association

---

## Non-Human Characters

**Non-Human Characters** (robots, animals, creatures):
- Structure can be adapted
- Must keep the same cute aesthetic
- Same face style applies (white eyes, black pupils, colored cheeks)
- Still use simple geometric shapes as base

**Personified Objects** (objects given personality, not actual characters):
- Keep the object's original form/shape
- ONLY add eyes and expressions
- Add whatever facial expressions are needed (eyes, cheeks, mouth)
- Do NOT restructure the object into a character body
- The object itself IS the body
